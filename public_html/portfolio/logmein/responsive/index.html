  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
  LogMeIn has an expansive portfolio of products and each one has a dedicated site with
  many unique paths to purchase. In addition to each product site, there is an
  all-encompassing site where visitors can learn at a higher level about each of the
  LogMeIn products. In 2019 I took over as the sole designer on the team responsible for
  this site, which was in the process of a transformation.

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>
  Shortly after I joined the team, our web analyst had announced a successful test of a
  previously redesigned homepage, products page, and solutions page. While these new pages
  had passed the test, they had only been tested on desktop, and responsive designs of the
  new pages were non-existent.
  </p>
  <p>
  For us to roll out the new pages for all visitors, I would need to first design the
  pages for tablet and mobile screen sizes, including a new mobile menu and navigation. My
  goal was to keep the overall design as close to the original as possible, without
  sacrificing usability, straying from the successful test results.
  </p>
  </section>
  <!-- Section: Solution -->
  <section class="solution">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
  I started by familiarizing myself with the previous designer's Sketch file and updated
  it to match the live environment. I went through a comprehensive UX heuristic
  evaluation, focused on usability, accessibility, and overall experience. I identified
  which sections could easily be translated to a narrow viewport, and which would need to
  be redesigned on desktop entirely, to function well across all sizes.

  Each of the three pages required an entirely responsive design treatment. Much of the
  layout was stacked as you can see on the homepage hero. I created a new responsive type
  scale which increased the font size and spacing on mobile for legibility.

  Next was the navigation, which I began by collaborating with another designer on my team

  an accordion pattern, which is consistent amongst other LogMeIn products.

  Now that all three pages were designed, I handed off the final Zeplin link for the
  developer to review. He then built each of the components in React, and I reviewed them
  for accuracy. We worked closely to confirm consistent styles, spacing, and most of all,
  usability before moving into the live environment.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
  Upon final review with the front end developer we were ready for back end development,
  the last step before deployment. We not only were ready to launch the new pages, but we
  had a new foundation of components in our React library to build from for other products
  and pages.
  </p>
  <p>
  This process proved to be successful, and I shared with the larger UX team the
  prototypes so they could use them for their pages as well. I emphasized the value of
  clickable prototypes for developer handoffs, as we not only saved time going back and
  forth but now had a high-fidelity prototype of mobile navigation in our toolkit.

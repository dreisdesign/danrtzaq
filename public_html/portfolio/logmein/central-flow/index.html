  <p>
  Central is a major product in the LogMeIn portfolio and is responsible for a significant
  amount of revenue for the company. For customers to purchase the Central product, they
  need to successfully navigate through several steps and pages.

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>
  Ownership of the purchase flow in the back end was split across multiple teams resulting
  in a disjointed experience, causing friction for our customers. We would need to migrate
  the back end to a new payment system which would allow us to create a seamless
  experience.
  </p>
  <p>
  My task was to come up with the strategy around how customers purchase the product,
  design a solution, test it, and work with our engineers to build it.
  </p>

  <!-- Section: Solution -->
  <section class="solution">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
  I conducted extensive user testing to truly understand the problems customers were
  facing. I also uncovered additional points of friction along the way. With this
  feedback, I redesigned the flow and continued testing iterations until ultimately
  landing on a final design geared towards usability and desirability.

  4-step flow. The process includes account creation, billing, payment, and ends with an

  I kicked off the process by designing a consolidated flow and building a clickable
  prototype in Invision to test against the original. I wrote the script to bring users
  through a series of tasks asking them to navigate through each prototype, compare their
  experience, and provide feedback along the way.

  I conducted additional research and along with feedback from early rounds of testing,
  hypothesized that the flow would be greatly improved with the addition of a pricing
  page. So, I redesigned the flow by replacing the customizer on the home page with a new
  pricing page and set off to do more tests.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
  The new pricing page was proven to be a winner over the customizer in user testing as people liked being
  able to change
  options and see the price update in the order summary. With the design complete, we presented to
  stakeholders and
  received approval to move forward with development.
  The next step is to develop the new flow and begin testing in production. Additional future steps would be
  to address
  the overall design of the homepage, which will require close collaboration with product marketing for
  additional
  copywriting and content.

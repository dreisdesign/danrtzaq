  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
  MikMak provides eCommerce marketing analytics and enablement software to accelerate
  online sales for brands. A MikMak eCommerce URL can be used either as a standalone
  landing page linked from an ad, or embedded into a brand's website.
  </p>
  <p>
  The page includes dynamic retailer buttons for online shopping and nearby locations.
  Beyond selling more products, brands leverage MikMak to gather data about the retailer
  and product preferences to influence strategy.

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>
  At the beginning of this project, MikMak was expanding from supporting grocery brands to
  other categories, specifically alcohol. In order to best support the sales of alcohol,
  we needed to provide a better in-store product locator because most sales of alcohol
  happen in stores.
  </p>
  <p>
  We would need better in-store data, and identified the interest to integrate the leading
  alcohol retailer and distributor data source provider called VIP (Vermont Information
  Processing) into the MikMak platform. This would expand our retailer data providing a
  better user experience for shoppers and allowing our customers, and brands, to learn
  more about shopper behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our challenge was to identify the best way to leverage this new data source so that we
  could provide the following for our customers:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Enables shoppable experiences across an omnichannel strategy</li>
  <li>
  Consumers can shop from big box stores, restaurants, and even to small local retailers
  </li>
  <li>
  Enables beverage brands to drive the shoppers to the closest locations to where
  consumers are shopping
  </li>
  <li>Changes how our customers leverage their omnichannel experiences</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <!-- Section: Solution -->
  <section class="solution">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
  I conducted extensive user testing to truly understand the problems customers were
  facing. I also uncovered additional points of friction along the way. With this
  feedback, I redesigned the flow and continued testing iterations until ultimately
  landing on a final design geared towards usability and desirability.
  </p>
  <p>
  I kicked off the research by learning how VIP data was being used in existing alcohol
  brand websites. We quickly found clear patterns and a range of existing implementations
  to choose from. I focused on identifying the key patterns we would need to leverage the
  data, and performed user testing to identify the most usable solutions, and then
  compiled them together. By pulling the best patterns we would create something new, yet
  familiar.
  </p>
  <p>
  To expedite feedback I simply ran user tests on actual websites (stonebrewing.com, etc)
  to find out which patterns are most intuitive.

  <b>Analyzing Existing Designs</b>

  I searched for existing alcohol websites with VIP data integration and analyzed the
  design patterns. I narrowed it down to 3 websites, each representing common filter
  patterns to find the most intuitive and easy to use. Next, I ran user tests on mobile
  and desktop.

  <b>Testing Different Scenarios</b>
  <span class="spacer"></span>
  Finally, I began testing different scenarios such as no retailers available because that
  was causing confusion in the testing. The clickable prototype was built from a single
  frame and utilized interactive variants in Figma for efficiency. Upon further review,
  this may have been overengineered, and it's something I have learned from.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
  The launch of this project was extremely positive for the company and the customers.
  "Positive market energy and feedback about VIP - “OMG I need this” “The next big thing
  for sales to lean into”. Diageo and Annheiser Busch are like WHAT?! Others said this was
  "The Holy grail - we can finally explain the full customer journey"
  </p>
  <p>
  Continued expansion and demand for this integration have significantly given MikMak a
  leg up in the alcohol space and plans to expand this functionality to more verticals are
  already in the works at the time of this posting.

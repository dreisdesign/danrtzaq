  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
  Colgate, the global leader in oral care products, aimed to improve their "where to buy"
  section on their website by replacing the filter-based system with a search field,
  simplifying the user experience and increasing customer satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>
  We aimed to make it easier for users to find and buy products by replacing the old
  filter system with a new search feature.

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>
  Colgate's filter system allowed users to narrow options by type, product line, and
  size/flavor. They wanted a search field to streamline the process. I aimed to ensure we
  solved the right problem, not just implement the requested feature.
  </p>
  </section>
  <!-- Section: Solution -->
  <section class="solution">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
  We aimed to simplify product discovery while maintaining efficiency. Our user-centered
  redesign focused on making the search functionality intuitive while meeting both user
  and client needs.
  </p>
  <p>
  After meeting with the brand team and receiving the initial request to "Add Search," the
  research and process began. We ran user tests, created a custom UX kit, and collaborated
  with engineering and the brand IT team. After many rounds of testing, iterations, and
  revisions, we presented a few options, not just for review but for clear communication.
  What follows is the rest of the process and the unexpected byproduct of the UX kit.

  <p class="content-caption">
  To ensure we solved the right problem, I researched similar "where to buy" features from
  brands like Ben &amp; Jerry's and Chobani. Initial user testing revealed that users
  struggled with the discoverability of the search feature, indicating it needed to be
  more prominent. I then conducted unmoderated user tests via UserTesting.com, targeting
  users who had purchased dental products in the last three months to validate the need
  for a search feature.

  I published the UX kit in Figma, making it easy to use elements from the assets panel
  for quick mockups. This streamlined our workflow, enabling efficient creation and
  iteration of design concepts for future projects.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
  The new Colgate template successfully launched, setting a precedent for using lo-fi
  wireframes as an effective communication tool. By focusing on the needs of Colgate's
  shoppers, we integrated search functionality while retaining useful filters,
  demonstrating a commitment to user-centric design. Effective communication with the
  client throughout the process ensured that their requirements were met and that the
  final product aligned with their expectations.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Positive Feedback:</strong>
  The new search feature was well-received by users, improving overall satisfaction.
  This highly popular template was requested by other customers and became known
  internally as the "Colgate Template".
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Next Steps:</strong>
  Early results showed increased user engagement and a higher rate of successful product
  searches. Looking ahead, we plan to use the insights gained from search data to
  further refine Colgate’s website and continuously improve the user experience.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Byproduct:</strong>
  The project illustrates the benefits of thinking in systems and creating reusable
  components, which we later used to improve similar features for other clients, such as
  Nestlé. The UX kit we developed for this project became a valuable asset, enabling us
  to replicate successful patterns across future projects.
